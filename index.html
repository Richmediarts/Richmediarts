		<strong>Wealth</strong> is the <a href="">abundance</a> of <a href="">valuable resources</a> or valuable material <a href="">possessions</a>. This includes the core meaning as held in the originating old English word <i>weal</i>, which is from an <a href="">Indo-European</a> word stem. An individual, community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy.

		The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of <a href="">economics</a>, and clearly so for <a href="">growth economics</a> and <a href="">development economics</a> yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. At the most general level, economists may define wealth as "anything of value" that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts. Defining wealth can be a <a href="">normative</a> process with various <a href="">ethical</a> implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own.

		The <a href="">United Nations</a> definition of <i>inclusive wealth</i> is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets. Natural capital includes land, forests, <a href="">energy resources</a>, and minerals. Human capital is the population's education and skills. Physical (or "manufactured") capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.
