		<strong>Wealth</strong> is the <a href="">abundance</a> of <a href="">valuable resources</a> or valuable material <a href="">possessions</a>. This includes the core meaning as held in the originating old English word <i>weal</i>, which is from an <a href="">Indo-European</a> word stem. An individual, community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy.
		</p>

		The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of <a href="">economics</a>, and clearly so for <a href="">growth economics</a> and <a href="">development economics</a> yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. At the most general level, economists may define wealth as "anything of value" that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts. Defining wealth can be a <a href="">normative</a> process with various <a href="">ethical</a> implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own.

		The <a href="">United Nations</a> definition of <i>inclusive wealth</i> is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets. Natural capital includes land, forests, <a href="">energy resources</a>, and minerals. Human capital is the population's education and skills. Physical (or "manufactured") capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.
